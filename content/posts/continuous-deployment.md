Deploying a new post to this blog is pretty easy. I just run these two commands:

```bash
hugo
firebase deploy only:hosting
```

However, this does require me to be on my computer to do a deployment. If I want to fix a spelling mistake, publish a draft, or update some content on another page I would have to be at home, on my computer. I wanted to what it would take to write and deploy a post from my phone.

Conceptually, there are two things that need to happen:

1. I need to be able to write a post, in markdown, on my phone, and save it to GitHub.
2. When there is a new commit to the repository, I need kick off a deployment.

With these two pieces in place, I should be able to writes posts and publish changes (easily) from my phone.

## Writing in Markdown

It turns out there are several Android apps for writing in markdown. However, it's still a bit of a pain to commit it to GitHub. Initially, I assumed I would just do some type of copy/paste job to GitHub's mobile website. I know it's not ideal, but how else do `git commit` on android? Well, as it turns out, there is a whole set of services related to git-based content editing. Content management systems (CMS) have been around for a long time. WordPress, is a very popular and well known one. It turns out there are some newer services that let you save your data directly to a GitHub repository.

## Forestry

So, this isn't how I was originally planning to accomplish my goal, but I've been pretty happy with what I've discovered so far. I tried out a service called [Forestry](https://forestry.io/ "Forestry"). With it you can create a new "site" and link it to a git repository.

I linked mine to GitHub. They also have support for BitBucket, Gitlab, and Azure Devops.

After linking a repository, you can pick your static site generator. I picked Hugo. They also have support for Jekyll, VuePress, and Gatsby, Eleventy, and others.

Forestry then imported my site and I saw all (three) of my blog posts show up.

The editor is a pretty straightforward WYSIWYG editor. I started writing this blog post on Forestry to test it out and it has worked pretty well. I saved my draft and saw a new commit added to my GitHub repository with the comment:

    Update from Forestry.io

Perfect! That wraps up step 1. I was able to write a post on my phone and save it to my GitHub repository.

## GitHub Actions

Now that I can write posts and commit changes to my repository, it was time to enable continuous deployments. I used [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions "GitHub Actions") is run a job on every commit to the `production` branch. This workflow leveraged pre-existing actions, so it was super quick to get up and running. The entire workflow file is less than 30 lines long and was created at `.github/workflows/main.yml`

    name: CI/CD
    on:
      push:
        branches: [production]
    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout
            uses: actions/checkout@v2
            
          - name: Setup Hugo
            uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
            with:
              hugo-version: "0.81.0"
              extended: true
              
          - name: Build Site
            run: hugo
            
          - name: Deploy to Firebase
            uses: w9jds/firebase-action@master
            with:
              args: deploy --only hosting
            env:
              FIREBASE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_TOKEN }}

Once this file was committed and there was a commit to the `production` branch, I went to the `Actions` tab to view the build.

Boom! The site was built and deployed in 30 seconds flat. 

I did a few more tests from Forestry and it worked like a charm. 

## Conclusion

Forestry is a neat little service that enabled me to more easily write and edit my blog, directly from my android phone. Paired with GitHub Actions, this quickly enabled continuous deployments whenever there was a change to the content stored in repository. Maybe now I'll do some more writing ðŸ˜‰

## Additional Notes

I originally did CI/CD on the one and only `dev` branch, but it seemed a little weird to run a whole deployment whenever I made a change to a draft post, so I updated it to use the `production` branch instead. Since Forestry commits to the `dev` branch, I technically will need to do a pull request to `production` before there's a deployment. This should be fine as it will allow me to more easily control and see what changes are being deployed.

Hugo has migrated from installing themes with `submodules` to [Hugo Modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/ "Hugo Modules"). I originally was using a`submodule`, so I had to add `submodules: true` under the `with:` section of the workflow file. I've since migrated to Hugo Modules and have found it to be a lot simpler to use.
